# MCORR multi-station crosscorrelation analysis

To "install" the code, at every MATLAB session type

```
>> addpath(genpath('/PATH/WEHERE/IS/DOWNLOADED/mcorr'))
```

The folder `bin` and the modules of `mcorr` will now be seen by MATLAB
and can be run everywhere in the system. The `bin` folder
contains all the necessary scripts to run the program.
Just type `help mcorr` for a reference.

Currently under development under the DEVELOP branch.
The `main` branch will be used only for releases
